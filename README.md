## Environments

1.	Configuring environments

Creating an Azure Service User (Core Service)Terraform uses a Core Service to interact with Azure:az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "your main service name" --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<subscription_id>"Copy the information provided:• AppID• Password• Tenant ID4.2 Initializing Terraform variablesCreate a terraform.tfvars file:subscription_id="your subscription_id"client_id="your client_id"client_secret= "your Client_secret"tenant_id = "your tenant_id"

To deploy the infrastructure, we'll use 3 commands:
-Terraform init :setting the stage for your infrastructure play
-Terraform plan :analyzes your Terraform configuration files. These files define the desired state of your infrastructure (the resources you want to exist).
-Terraform Apply:takes the execution plan generated by terraform plan and executes the proposed actions.

Now we are ready to build our infrastructure !
